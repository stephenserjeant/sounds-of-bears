# The Sounds of BEARS
## The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, BEARS

The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, or BEARS, is a observational campaign on the [Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA)](https://almascience.eso.org/) to measure the redshifts of the brightest submillimetre galaxies on the Southern sky, discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory. So far we have measured secure (e.g. two-line) spectroscopic redshifts for 71 submillimetre galaxies in the [Herschel ATLAS](https://www.h-atlas.org/) South Galactic Pole field, which we published in [Urquhart et al. 2022 (BEARS paper I)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3017U/abstract), and the continuum photometry will be published in Bendo et al. MN submitted (BEARS paper II). The emission line properties of the bright Herschel-selected galaxies in South Galactic Pole will soon be published in Hagimoto et al. 2022 (BEARS paper III).  

## The sounds of BEARS

It's important for astronomy to become more accessible, so we've used the [sonoUno](https://www.sonouno.org.ar/) package developed by the [REINFORCE](https://www.reinforceeu.eu/) project to sonify some of our ALMA data. This page shows you what we've done, and walks you through how you can do it for yourself.

## Going from CARTA to sonoUno

Insert a video here! The way to do that is described [here](https://www.cazzulino.com/github-pages-embed-video.html) and the key point is to go to Issues, create a new Issue, and drop the video in there. After it's processed, then you will see a URL. That URL can be used to embed the video, as per the example below. NB web uploads are limited to 25Mb per file. 

Here is an example:

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/stephenserjeant/sounds-of-bears/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Below is the default help text that comes with the theme. Feel free to delete it when you are comfortable with editing! 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/stephenserjeant/sounds-of-bears.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
