# The Sounds of BEARS

The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, or BEARS, is a wonderful project for all these reasons, blah blah.

It's important for astronomy to become more accessible, so we've used the sonoUno package developed by the REINFORCE project to sonify some of our ALMA data. This page shows you what we've done, and walks you through how you can do it for yourself.

# Going from CARTA to sonoUno

Insert a video here! The way to do that is described [here](https://www.cazzulino.com/github-pages-embed-video.html) and the key point is to go to Issues, create a new Issue, and drop the video in there. After it's processed, then you will see a URL. That URL can be used to embed the video, as per the example below. NB web uploads are limited to 25Mb per file. 

Here is an example:

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11993612/184339026-d023d906-90fc-44c4-9dda-59a155d790ac.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 730px;">
</video>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/stephenserjeant/sounds-of-bears.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
