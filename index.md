## The Sounds of BEARS

The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, or BEARS, is a wonderful project for all these reasons, blah blah.

It's important for astronomy to become more accessible, so we've used the sonoUno package developed by the REINFORCE project to sonify some of our ALMA data. This page shows you what we've done, and walks you through how you can do it for yourself.
