# The Sounds of BEARS
## The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, BEARS

The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, or BEARS, is a project on the [Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA)](https://almascience.eso.org/) to measure the redshifts of the brightest submillimetre galaxies on the Southern sky, discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory. So far we have measured secure (e.g. two-line) spectroscopic redshifts for 71 submillimetre galaxies in the [Herschel ATLAS](https://www.h-atlas.org/) South Galactic Pole field, which we published in [Urquhart et al. 2022 (BEARS paper I)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3017U/abstract), and the continuum photometry will be published in Bendo et al. MN submitted (BEARS paper II). The emission line properties of the bright Herschel-selected galaxies in South Galactic Pole will soon be published in Hagimoto et al. 2022 (BEARS paper III).  

## The sounds of BEARS

It's important for astronomy to become more accessible, so we've used the [sonoUno](https://www.sonouno.org.ar/) package developed by the [REINFORCE](https://www.reinforceeu.eu/) project to sonify some of our ALMA data. This page shows you what we've done, and walks you through how you can do it for yourself.

## Going from CARTA to sonoUno

Our BEARS survey data is now public on the ALMA archive, so it's possible to go from the CARTA interface in the ALMA Science Archive all the way to a sonification. Here is an example:

## More sonifications

We will put in more material here as we make it.
