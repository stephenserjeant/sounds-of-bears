# The Sounds of BEARS
## The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, BEARS

The Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, or BEARS, is a observational campaign on the [Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA)](https://almascience.eso.org/) to measure the redshifts of the brightest submillimetre galaxies on the Southern sky, discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory. So far we have measured secure (e.g. two-line) spectroscopic redshifts for 71 submillimetre galaxies in the [Herschel ATLAS](https://www.h-atlas.org/) South Galactic Pole field, which we published in [Urquhart et al. 2022 (BEARS paper I)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3017U/abstract), and the continuum photometry will be published in Bendo et al. MN submitted (BEARS paper II). The emission line properties of the bright Herschel-selected galaxies in South Galactic Pole will soon be published in Hagimoto et al. 2022 (BEARS paper III).  

## The sounds of BEARS

It's important for astronomy to become more accessible, so we've used the [sonoUno](https://www.sonouno.org.ar/) package developed by the [REINFORCE](https://www.reinforceeu.eu/) project to sonify some of our ALMA data. This page shows you what we've done, and walks you through how you can do it for yourself.
